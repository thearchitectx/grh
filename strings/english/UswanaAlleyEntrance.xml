<s id="gamble-1">Hey... Hello, pretty girl...</s>
<s id="gamble-2">Uuhh... Hi...</s>
<s id="gamble-3">You look like a clever one... Would you like to test your focus and try some honest gambling in an exciting game?</s>
<s id="gamble-4">I... I'm sorry... I don't have time for that...</s>
<s id="gamble-5">Don't be shy, pretty girl... This is a fun game!</s>
<s id="gamble-6">Uuhh... Maybe later... I'm busy now...</s>

<s id="gamble-w-1">I... Actually I'm searching for some kind of tool... like a wrench...</s>
<s id="gamble-w-2">Any chances you offer something like this as prize?</s>
<s id="gamble-w-3">Very sorry, pretty girl... We value financial liquidity here! Only good old green imperialist money here in bets and prizes...</s>
<s id="gamble-w-4">I... I thought this kind of money was illegal in this country...</s>
<s id="gamble-w-5">No no no... Our president made it illegal only to carry the green money from outside... There's no law against trading it here inside the country...</s>
<s id="gamble-w-6">This made the imperialist money very very valuable in Uswana... Our president probably has a big stash of it himself... Isn't he a genius?</s>
<s id="gamble-w-7">I don't know if 'genius' is the correct word to classify men like him...</s>
<s id="gamble-w-8">I'll pretend I didn't heard what you said because you probably don't know that open criticism against our government is also a crime...</s>
<s id="gamble-w-9">I'll be here all day... Just talk to me when you're ready to have fun and win some easy money...</s>
<s id="gamble-w-10">I don't know if I should get into this gambling thing unless I have a real need for more money...</s>

<s id="gamble-p-0">If I really need more money then this game is my only chance...</s>
<s id="gamble-p-1">So... Are we going to play anytime?</s>
<s id="gamble-p-2">I don't know if I should...</s>
<s id="gamble-p-3">Look... What about a quick demo? Let's play one without placing any bets so you can feel how it works, okay?</s>
<s id="gamble-p-4">Here... Check these 3 identical cups...</s>
<s id="gamble-p-5">First I place a little ball under one of these...</s>
<s id="gamble-p-6">And then you must keep a sharp eye, because I'll shuffle the cups around this surface...</s>
<s id="gamble-p-7">Now... If you are able to guess under which cup the ball is, you win... Simple as that...</s>
<s id="gamble-p-8">Come on... Pick one... Under which of these cups is the ball?</s>
<s id="gamble-p-9-w">Very good... You have talent! Wasn't it easy?</s>
<s id="gamble-p-9-l">Oopsie... I usually don't shuffle so fast, so next time you'll have a better chance! Easy, huh?</s>
<s id="gamble-p-10">Now you can place a bet before we start the next round so the game becomes really exciting!!</s>
<s id="gamble-p-11">Mininum bet is $5000 greens!</s>
<s id="gamble-p-12">Whoah... Isn't it like... too much money for such game?</s>
<s id="gamble-p-13">Well... This is a high stakes table, pretty girl! A greater risk means much more fun! Let's do this...</s>
<s id="gamble-p-14">This man sounds very fishy... But I need money to have access to the Goddess Slab, and this might be the only way in...</s>
<s id="gamble-p-15">It doesn't seem a very hard game... But it's risky anyways...</s>

<s id="game-no-money-1">But, hey... You already took all the money I had to gamble today...</s>
<s id="game-no-money-2">I hope you make a good use of it, because the boss won't be happy with it...</s>

<s id="game-dont-try-body-1">Oh... And don't even try exposing yourself as a trick again...</s>
<s id="game-dont-try-body-2">As much as I'd love to see more, I might get in trouble with the boss if I let you easily win again...</s>

<s id="game-bet-1000">Bet $1000</s>
<s id="game-bet-5000">Bet $5000</s>
<s id="game-bet-no">NOT NOW</s>

<s id="game-distract-body-0">Now... Show some skin to distract him</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-1">You'll need to show MORE skin to distract him now</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-2">Just show A LOT of skin to distract him again</s>
<s id="game-distract-now">Take a picture now!</s>
<s id="game-distract-no">Let him shuffle</s>

<s id="game-distract-flash">Use the camera flash to stun him</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-0-1">Hey... Look here... I love taking pictures during my travels...</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-0-2">Huuh??</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-0-3">Ouch... Watch the flash, pretty girl... This thing almost burned my retina...</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-1-1">Hey... Let me take another picture...</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-1-2">What? Wait a...</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-1-3">Jesus Christ... Give a break with the photos, will you? It hurts by brain!</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-2-1">It's time for another picture!</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-2-2">Oh no... Not again...</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-2-3">Okay... Last warning! If you use that camera again you'll know a much less friendly version of me...</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-3-1">It's time for another picture!</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-3-2">Don't you dare to...</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-hit-1">I told you to not do it, bitch... I'm done playing nice with you...</s>
<s id="game-distract-flash-hit-2">Are you blacking out? Good... It makes my life easier...</s>

<s id="game-distract-flash-end">Oh... I'm sorry... Let's get back to the game, right?</s>

<s id="game-place-bet">Okay... I'll bet $<d character="Player" data="BET" /></s>

<s id="game-bet-no-money-1">I'm not sure about this... I don't have money to cover this bet...</s>
<s id="game-bet-no-money-2">But I don't have much time to recover the Goddess Slab...</s>
<s id="game-bet-no-money-3">Well... If you're not able to cover your bet then you'd better not lose the game... Or our friendly gambler might become much less... friendly...</s>
<s id="game-bet-do-it">DO IT</s>
<s id="game-lost-no-money-1">I... I'm sorry... I don't have any money to pay you...</s>
<s id="game-lost-no-money-2">Oh, please... You're so funny... Stop joking, pretty girl...</s>
<s id="game-lost-no-money-3">I'm very sorry, sir... I'm not joking...</s>

<s id="game-run-1">Amazing! Let's have fun!</s>
<s id="game-run-2">Here is the ball... Now let's see if you can follow where it goes...</s>
<s id="game-run-3">Okay... Now pick the right one!</s>

<s id="game-fast-1">Hey... You... You moved much faster now than before... It's... It's not fair...</s>
<s id="game-fast-2">Oh... Did I? I've been playing this game for a long time... I think my skills are developing quite well then...</s>
<s id="game-fast-3">Oh my God... I don't know if I could follow his moves at that speed...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel">ASK TO CANCEL THE BET</s>
<s id="game-fast-guess">MAKE A GUESS</s>

<s id="game-fast-cancel-1">I want to cancel the bet... You never said you could shuffle that fast...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-2">Sigh... Okay, pretty girl... I'll allow you to cancel only this time... I'm still here if you want to try again...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-3">Goddamnit... I knew this was looking too easy to be true... The odds are not favorable if I play this based on pure luck...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-4">Maybe if you find a way to distract him, he will shuffle a little slower and make things easier for you...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-5">A distraction? What could I do?</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-5-body-1">Your body is quite distracting...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-5-body-2">Your body is quite distracting, <d character="Lara" />... If you know what I mean...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-5-body-3">Oh... I... think I do...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-5-look-1">Look around...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-5-look-2">Look around... This place is like a junkyard... Maybe if you search really carefully you might find something to distract him</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-5-look-3">Thank you, <d character="Player" suffix="..." /> You always give me hope with your ideas when I think everything is lost...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-5-look-4">But I... I was hoping to avoid contact with this dirty floor...</s>
<s id="game-fast-cancel-6">Go on... Be creative...</s>

<s id="game-won-1">Congratulations! You won this round!</s>
<s id="game-won-2">Yes!</s>
<s id="game-won-3">You are in a lucky streak, pretty girl...</s>

<s id="game-lost-1">Oups... Better luck next time!</s>
<s id="game-lost-2">Damn it!</s>
<s id="game-lost-3">Well... You owe me $<d character="Player" data="BET" suffix="," /> pretty girl...</s>
<s id="game-lost-4">Urgh... Okay... Take it...</s>
<s id="game-lost-5">Don't get sad... Try another round and you might get your money back!</s>


<s id="game-distract-body-0-1">_I hope this distraction plan will make him slow down his moves..._</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-0-2">Whoah...</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-0-3">You know... I never knew this country is so hot... I... I'm sweating...</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-0-4">Yeah... Yeah... Try to get some wind over your skin, pretty girl... It will surely help you cool down...</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-0-5">Stay just like this... while I... I should start game now...</s>

<s id="game-distract-body-1-1">_It worked the last time... But if I want him to keep playing slow I need to go further with this..._</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-1-2">Oh, boy...</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-1-3">I'm... I'm melting here... Is it a heat wave or something?</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-1-4">Yeah, baby... Just keep what you're doing and you'll be fine... And I'm right here if you need my help...</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-1-5">Oh... I almost forgot we need to keep playing...</s>

<s id="game-distract-body-2-1">_I hope I'm not... exagerating... But I need to keep doing this to have a chance in the game..._</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-2-2">Jesus Christ... That's it...</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-2-3">Oh... I... I just can't stand all this heat and...</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-2-4">You don't have to say another word, baby...</s>
<s id="game-distract-body-2-5">I know exactly what you want...</s>
